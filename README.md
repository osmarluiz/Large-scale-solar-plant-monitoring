# Large-scale-solar-plant-monitoring

This repository contains information regarding the paper "Remote Sensing for Monitoring of Photovoltaic Power Plants in Brazil Using Deep Semantic Segmentation" which is currently submitted to Energies (MDPI)

The dataset is publicly available containing all active large-scale power solar plants in the Brazilian territory. The ground truth annotations were done by a specialist from the Brazilian National Agency (ANEEL).

In this practical application we applied models from the https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models repository. Besides we proposed a mosaicking algorithm to classify images with indefinite sizes using overlapping pixels.
