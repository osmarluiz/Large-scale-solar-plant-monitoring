# Large-scale-solar-plant-monitoring

This repository contains information regarding the paper "Remote Sensing Monitoring of Large-Scale Solar Power Plants in the Brazilian Territory Using U-net with Efficient-net, Res-Net, ResNeXt, and VGG16 Encoders" which is currently submitted to Energies (MDPI)

The dataset is publicly available containing all active large-scale power solar plants in the Brazilian territory. The ground truth annotations were done by a specialist from the Brazilian National Agency (ANEEL).

In this practical application we applied models from the https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models repository. Besides we proposed a mosaicking algorithm to classify images with indefinite sizes using overlapping pixels.
